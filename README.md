# Employee Attrition Prediction ML Project

[CHECK IT OUT HERE! ðŸš€](https://eshagarwal.github.io/ML_Gisma_Project/)

## Overview
This project implements machine learning models to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to identify key factors that influence employee turnover and build predictive models to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) dataset. It includes:
- 1,470 employee records
- 35 features including demographics, job role, satisfaction levels
- Target variable: Attrition (Yes/No)
